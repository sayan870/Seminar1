<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>Because you go down the mountain sideways on a snowboard, youâ€™ll have to choose which foot will be your lead foot, just like on a skateboard, wakeboarders, or surfboard. This is referred to in snowboarding as your stance, with two options, regular and goofy. Knowing which stance you are ahead of time will speed up your board setup at the mountain, and help you get started making turns more naturally.</p>
